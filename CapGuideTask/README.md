# Welcome to the repository!

This repository helps in determining the top 10 colleges for Civil Engineering at Savitribai Phule University. To do so, we first scrape the data off of the pdf provided by the Maharashtra government. Then with the help of pandas, we do the processing to get the results.

Work to determine the top 10 colleges considering cut-off ranks of various categories is going on. More commits will be done in future. Star the repo for updates!
